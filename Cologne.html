            Cologne is home to about one million people — and about six million
            visitors come to this metropolis on the Rhine every year to explore
            the city and its tourist attractions. Of course the most outstanding
            highlights are Cologne Cathedral and the city’s 12 famous Romanesque
            churches. One good thing about Cologne is that you can combine
            visits to many highlights, monuments, hotspots and museums by simply
            walking around — for example, from the Cathedral through the
            Altstadt (Old Town) to the Rheinauhafen (Rheinau Harbour) district
            and back along the Rhine. Or you can visit the Zoo and the Flora
            botanical garden, cross the Rhine in a cable car and walk back along
            the right bank, crossing the Rhine again to the Cathedral via the
            Hohenzollernbrücke with its load of “love locks” weighing many
            tonnes. Cologne is a green metropolis with many attractive parks and
            gardens that offer pleasant opportunities to relax after gathering
            so many new impressions.
